    <h2>LARKS FOR LONDONERS.</h2>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;Certainly throw open all our Town Halls for
    gratuitous concerts and dances! But that's not half enough.
    Some of us don't care for dancing, and abhor music. What I
    propose is that Free Billiard-tables should be established in
    each parish. Billiards is much better exercise than sitting
    still on a chair listening to singing. Then there ought to be
    places where one could get municipal tobacco without paying for
    it. Tobacco is just as much a necessary of life as
    education&mdash;more so, in fact, in my opinion. On winter
    evenings it would also be nice to be able to step over to one's
    Town Hall and have a glass or two of free ale, or "wine from
    the wood"&mdash;also from the rates. I don't pay rates myself,
    as I happen to live in a flat, but I am sure the ratepayers
    will immediately recognise the justice of my demands.</p>

    <p class="author">UNBIASSED.</p>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;By all means let us try to give more pleasure to
    the people. The pleasure, however, should be of a distinctly
    elevating kind. I would advocate throwing open the South
    Kensington Natural History Museum in the evening. This would be
    most useful, especially to people living at the East End, and
    the amusement thus afforded, though perhaps not rollicking,
    would at all events be solid. To keep out undesirable
    characters, it would be as well to admit nobody who could not
    produce his baptismal certificate, and a recommendation from
    the clergyman of his parish, countersigned by a resident J.P. I
    am sure that people would jump at a chance of an evening among
    the <i>Coleoptera</i>.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, NATURALIST.</p>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;I cannot understand why people should ask for
    more amusement than they get at present. Have not they the
    Parks to walk about in? In wet weather they can take shelter
    under trees. In winter they ought to stay at home in the
    evenings, and enjoy reading aloud to their families. I would
    even go so far as to allow an occasional game at draughts.
    Chess is too exciting, and of course backgammon is out of the
    question, because of the deadly dice-box. For the frivolously
    inclined, "Puss in the Corner" is a harmless indoor game. I
    throw out these observations for what they may be worth, and
    trusting that they will not be regarded as dangerously
    subversive of morality, I remain,</p>

    <p class="author">Yours grimly, HOME, SWEET HOME!</p>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;The movement for turning our Town Halls into
    places of amusement is an excellent one. What I would like to
    suggest is, that the Vestrymen should themselves take part in
    the entertainments. Why not have weekly theatrical
    performances, with parts found for all local Authorities? I
    feel convinced that <i>Hamlet</i>, played by our Vestry, would
    be worth going miles to see. The Dust Contractor could play the
    <i>Ghost</i>, while minor characters could be sustained by the
    Medical Officer of Health, the Chaplain of the Workhouse, and
    others; the Chairman, of course, would figure in the title
    <i>rôle</i>. A topical comic song, by the Board of Guardians,
    with breakdown, might serve as a pleasing interlude; breakdowns
    in local matters are, I believe, not unknown already. The idea
    is worth considering. I think the Vestrymen owe something to
    the ratepayers in return for the votes we give them.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, MERRY ANDREW.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>BRUISERS AND BOLUSES.&mdash;A "Champion" pugilist is even
    more presumptuous than a popular Pill. He claims to be "Worth a
    Thousand Guineas a 'Box.'"</p>

    <p>BACON AND A MOUTHFUL.&mdash;Last Friday His Honour Judge
    BACON had to decide a case which was headed in the papers
    "Cagliostromantheon." What a mouthful! Mrs. CHURCHILL-JODRELL,
    who was a fair defendant, won the case; and His
    Honour&mdash;this appeal having been made to His Honour by Mr.
    B. PLAYFAIR, an excellent name for any gentleman, on or off the
    stage, but especially for one described as "an
    actor,"&mdash;decided that His Honour was satisfied. Peace with
    His Honour!</p>

    <h2>WITH THE B.M.A. AT BOURNEMOUTH.</h2>

    <p>In order to satisfy myself as to truth in conflicting
    reports about Bournemouth as a summer resort, I take express
    12·30 from Waterloo, and go straight away to my terminus,
    stopping, if I remember rightly, only twice on the road.
    First-rate run, through lovely scenery, with the London and
    South-Western Pack; found at Waterloo, and, with the exception
    of a slight check of only three minutes at Southampton
    Water&mdash;scent generally lost where water is, I
    believe&mdash;and another of a few seconds at Brockenhurst, ran
    into our quarry at Bournemouth Station West, in just two hours
    and a half. [<i>Happy Thought</i>.&mdash;Lunch <i>en route</i>,
    between 12·30 and 3. Pullman cars attached to some trains, not
    all. Certainly recommend Pullman, where possible; all comforts
    at hand for eating and drinking: likewise smoking-room,
    &amp;c., &amp;c.]</p>

             COMING&mdash;"

        <p>"There, my dear Sir; there's your room, and I'm only
        charmed to have your company."&mdash;<i>Extract from Speech
        of the Hearty Hotel-Proprietor to Un-illustrious
        Visitor</i>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Generally understood that Bournemouth is the Monte Carlo, or
    Nice, or Monaco, or Riviera of England. May be it is; if so,
    Monte Carlo, and the rest can't be so hot in summer as they are
    painted, for Bournemouth just now is (I speak of the last week
    in July) at a delightfully mean temperature,&mdash;if I may be
    allowed to use the word "mean" without implying any sort of
    disrespect for the Bournemouthers.</p>

    <p>Bournemouth apparently crowded. Do not remember it on any
    previous occasional visit, in autumn or spring, so crowded as
    at this present moment. Odd!</p>

    <p>"Not at all," explains flyman; "British Medical Association
    here. All sorts of festivities. Hotels all crowded. Lodgings
    too."</p>

    <p>If the worst come to the worst, I shall have to spend a
    night in a bathing-machine. Not bad: if fine. Can be called
    early; then sea-bath; also man to bring hot water and towels.
    While speculating on this probability, we arrive at</p>

    <p><i>Royal Bath Hotel</i>.&mdash;Flag flying, showing that
    British Medical Association Family are at home. Other flags
    elsewhere express same idea. B.M.A. at home everywhere, of
    course. Array of servants in brown liveries and gilt buttons in
    outer hall, preparing to receive visitors. Pleasant and
    courteous Manager&mdash;evidently Manager&mdash;with foreign
    accent receives me smilingly. "Any difficulty about rooms?" I
    ask, nervously. "None whatever in your case," returns courteous
    Manager, bowing most graciously as he emphasises the possessive
    pronoun. In the hall are trim young ladies, pleasant matronly
    ladies, chorus of young porters and old porters, all smiling,
    and awaiting my lightest bow and heaviest baggage. I am "to be
    shown up." (<i>Absit omen!</i>) However, I am shown up.
    Charming room: sea-view, nearly all the views from the windows
    of Royal Bath are sea-views, take the Bath which way you will;
    and the welcome is so warm, it ought to be The Warm Bath
    Hotel.</p>

    <p>I am looking for something which has probably been left in
    the hall. "Let me see," I say, musingly, to myself, as I look
    round; "where's my waterproof with two capes? I've
    missed&mdash;er&mdash;" I hesitate, being still uncertain.</p>

    <p>A sprightly Boots is going hurriedly out of the room. He
    pauses in his swift career, as if catching my last words. I
    hear him repeat, "Missed&mdash;er&mdash;" and then "Capes." To
    this he adds, sharply, "Yes, Sir, I'll tell him," and
    vanishes.</p>

    <p>"<i>Tell him?</i>" Oh, probably he means that he will tell
    the other Boots to bring up my waterproof with the double
    capes. But to make assurance doubly sure, I go to the top of
    the stairs and call out, "Wrapper&mdash;with two
    capes&mdash;probably in the hall&mdash;don't see it here." To
    which, from somewhere down below in obscurity, the voice of the
    Boots comes up to me, "Capes in the hall," then something
    inaudible, finishing with, "up there."</p>

    <p>I return to my apartment. Lovely view. Open window. Balmy
    and refreshing breeze. Becoming aware of the fact that I have
    left the door open, expecting return of Boots with waterproof
    wrapper, I am turning to shut it, when "to me enters" as the
    old stage-directions have it, a distinguished-looking
    gentleman, bearded and moustached, white-vested, and generally
    "in full fig."&mdash;(<i>Mem.</i>&mdash;Write to <i>Notes and
    Queries, Unde derivatur</i>&mdash;"Full fig?") who advances
    briskly but quietly towards me. My visitor has evidently made
    some mistake in the number of his room. At least, I hope the
    mistake isn't on <i>my</i> part, or on the urbane Manager's
    part, in putting me up here. Smart visitor bows. I am about to
    explain that he is in error, and that this is my room, when he
    deprecates any remark by saying, "Delighted to meet you; my
    name is CAPES. The porter told me you wished to see me. I am
    sure, Sir, I am more than delighted to see <i>you</i>!" and he
    proffers his hand, which I take and shake heartily, at the same
    time wondering where on earth we have met before, and why he
    should be so effusively joyful at seeing me again. Suddenly, as
    I release his hand, I see where the mistake is, and how it has
    arisen. A brilliant flash of memory recalls to my mind that in
    an advertisement I have read how this hotel belongs to Mr.
    CAPES,&mdash;Mr. NORFOLK CAPES, F.R.G.S., &amp;c., &amp;c. This
    amiable gentleman who bids me welcome so heartily is the
    Proprietor himself. I also am delighted. "Very kind of him to
    take this trouble," I say.</p>

    <p>"Not at all," he won't hear of there being any special
    kindness on his part. And as to trouble!&mdash;well, he scouts
    that idea with an energetic wave of his hand. Now, he wants to
    know, what will I do, where will I go, what will I take?
    Section A. of the Medical Association is meeting in the Town
    Hall, but I shall be late for that; or "perhaps," suggests the
    considerate Proprietor, "you would like to rest a bit before
    dinner at seven. Then there's the Concert afterwards. I have
    tickets for you, and no doubt on your return you'll have a
    cigar in the smoking-room with your friends, and be glad to get
    to bed."</p>

    <p>I thank him: most kind. I say, smilingly, that "No doubt,
    shall meet some friends;" a remark which seems to tickle him
    immensely. As a matter of fact, however, I confide to him that
    I should prefer keeping myself quiet this evening, as I have so
    much to do to-morrow morning.</p>

    <p>"Of course you have," assents the Proprietor most
    sympathetically. "And you'd like to rest as much as possible
    to-night after your journey. You'd like a table to yourself a
    little later. No&mdash;no&mdash;no thanks, I'm only too
    delighted."</p>

    <p>And, so saying, the kind Proprietor leaves me to see to the
    hundred-and-one things he has to do to-day, only stopping the
    Boots, who now arrives with the double-caped waterproof I had
    sent him for, to point me out to him, and to tell him to order
    a private table for me in the <i>salle à manger</i>
    "at&mdash;at?"&mdash;he queries&mdash;and I reply by inquiring
    if I may fix it for 7·45, as the room will be quieter then.
    "Certainly," says Mr. NORFOLK CAPES, without making the
    slightest difficulty about it. Then, turning to Boots, he says,
    "7·45," whereupon Boots repeats the mystic formula. And thus
    'tis arranged.</p>

    <p>Delightful gardens of Hotel. Stroll out on to cliff.
    Beautiful air, not the least enervating. On the contrary,
    refreshing. Returning later on to dress, I see the <i>salle à
    manger</i> full to overflowing. The Medicals are all feeding
    well and wisely, as Medicals ought to do. A pleasant company.
    Only a few of the younger and idler spirits remain when I sit
    down to my dinner about eight. Excellent <i>cuisine</i>.
    Couldn't be better. Salmon-trout from Christchurch, Poole

    <p>Lovely night. Then, after a stroll, "to bed," as <i>Lady
    Macbeth</i> observes. Sensible person, <i>Lady Mac</i>.</p>

    <p>On second thoughts will look at papers in smoking-room. Am
    alone at first, but in a few minutes room crowded. Medical
    Association has returned in force. I catch occasional bits in
    conversation:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Pity MCSIMMUM (or some name very like this) couldn't come.
    Great pity; missed him immensely." (Here several stories about
    MCSIMMUM, all evidently more or less good, and all interesting.
    I myself begin to wish that MCSIMMUM had arrived. He would have
    been an acquisition.) More medical men of various ages and with
    variety of spectacles. All enjoying themselves
    thoroughly,&mdash;quite medical boys out for a
    holiday,&mdash;but every one of them, individually and
    collectively, intensely regretting the absence of Dr. MCSIMMUM.
    I hear the voice of my friend Mr. CAPES in the passage. I will
    ask Mr. CAPES about this celebrated Dr. MCSIMMUM, whom
    evidently I ought to know, at least by repute. Perhaps I have
    known him by sight for years; perhaps he is a man with whom I
    often dine at the Club, and who entertains us in the
    smoking-room with strange stories of odd patients. His name I
    have heard long ago. Was it MCSIMMUM? Not unlikely. Can't
    remember.</p>

    <p>Mr. CAPES is energetically explaining and protesting to
    everybody. Amid the hum and buzz of voices, I catch what he is
    saying. It is, "My dear Sir, Dr. MCSIMMUM <i>is</i> here. I've
    seen him. He dined <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
       id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> alone. He said he preferred
       it, as he had so much to do to-morrow." Then several
       exclaim, "But <i>where</i> is he <i>now</i>?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know," replies the Proprietor. "Most likely, being
    tired, he has gone to bed. I myself showed him to his room, No.
    142, on his arrival."</p>

    <p>Heavens! The number of my room&mdash;is 142! Not another man
    in <i>there</i>! No.... I see it all now, <i>I am Dr.
    MCSIMMUM!</i> The real MCSIMMUM hasn't arrived, and he hasn't
    sent a message. This accounts for my welcome, and the absence
    of all difficulty in obtaining a room. But if he arrives now!
    where shall <i>I</i> be?</p>

    <p>"What's that about MCSIMMUM?" says a jovial voice, coming
    right into the midst of them.</p>

    <p>To which inquiry responds a chorus, "He's here! Mr. CAPES
    says so, but no one's seen him."</p>

    <p>"And no one's likely to." returns the cheery speaker. "He's
    staying with some friends a little way out of the town. He has
    just sent me a note by hand to say that he won't occupy his
    room till to-morrow, and will be much obliged if Mr. CAPES will
    forward by bearer a bag that was labelled and addressed to the
    room taken for him here, No. 142."</p>

             </a>"&mdash;&mdash; Speed the Parting Guest."
    </div>

    <p>"But&mdash;" exclaims the Proprietor, aghast,
    "but&mdash;"</p>

    <p>At this moment I catch sight of the man with the cheery
    voice. Saved! I know him. It is my old friend, Sir JOHN
    HARTLEY, M.D., who, years ago, told me there was nothing the
    matter with me, only I must take a holiday and go abroad to get
    better (most excellent advice, and I've never been quite well
    since), and who now exclaims, with all his old breadth of
    manner, "What <i>you</i> here! Bravo! We'll make you an
    honorary member!"</p>

    <p>The Proprietor looks at me, and I at the Proprietor. I know
    what is passing through the mind of Mr. NORFOLK CAPES, F.R.G.S.
    and P.R.B.H. I hasten to relieve his anxiety by saying,
    "Thanks; I'm here only for the night; I'm off to-morrow. I've
    just come down here to look for a house. By the way, I rather
    think that Dr. MCSIMMUM's bag must be in my room. Let's
    see."</p>

    <p>So I depart with the Proprietor. Explanations <i>en
    route</i>. Dr. MCSIMMUM's bag has been placed in my room, I
    should say in <i>his</i> room. But I've got the apartment, and
    if it hadn't been for the mistake, I should have been homeless
    and houseless, and a wanderer on the face of the sand at
    Bournemouth. Must write to that best of all doctors, MCSIMMUM,
    and thank him for not coming to-night.</p>

    <p>As it is I spend a delightful evening with the Members of
    the B.M.A. here assembled, in the smoking-room. The
    conversation is chiefly about the use of alcohol and tobacco as
    poisons. The decision arrived at towards one o'clock A.M., or,
    more correctly speaking, the Inn-decision, is that, on this
    particular occasion, one glass more of something or other, and
    just one last pipe or cigar, cannot possibly hurt anybody. This
    is carried <i>nem. con.</i>: and so, subsequently, we adjourn,
    not carried but walking, soberly and honestly, to bed.</p>

    <p>Next morning up with the lark, indeed a trifle earlier, and
    after examining Bournemouth and finding excellent residences up
    above in beautiful air where it must always be breezy, I thank
    Mr. NORFOLK CAPES, F.R.G.S. and P.R.B.H for the Hospitality
    shown me in his exceptionally pleasant house, and I return by
    the swift 2·5 P.M. train, which lands me at Vauxhall at 4·30 to
    the moment. Of course I am now expecting my diploma as Honorary
    Member of the British Medical Association.</p>

    the picter as I seed on the werry larst day of July larst week,
    when, by such a series of good lucks as I ardly ever had afore,
    I was priveledged for to see the Rite Honerable the Lord MARE
    prepare hisself, with his two lately benighted Sheriffs, in the
    most scrumptious of their many rich dresses, and with the solid
    gold Carsket as was guv to the HEMPERER of GARMANY about a
    fortnight ago, and had most misteriously cum back from abroad,
    all for to be photograffed altogether in one big grupe, with
    all the Aldermen as they coud find handy in their rich crimson
    silk dresses, and several werry Common Counsellers and Town
    Clarks and Remembrensers, et setterer, in horder as the longing
    world may see what sorts of Gents they was, and how they all
    looked when in their werry best close, and with their lovely
    solid gold deckorations on (as the HEMPERER and the Prince of
    WALES begged and prayed as they might have one a-peace) who
    arranged and carried out the grandest show of modern times,
    wiz, when the GERMAN HEMPEROR and his wife cum to Guildhall.
    Oh, wasn't they a long wile before the Gent coud get 'em all
    into good places, and didn't they all look sollem, when he
    said, "Quite steddy, please!"</p>

    poority and his black Cocked Hat of Power all most bewtifoolly
    and kindly arranged for him by the hartistic Sheriff.</p>

    <p>And then what a lesson on trew humility, to see the Lord

    <p>"SOLLY (of Hatfield), and SMIFF (who hails from Greenlands),
    started yesterday (November 25), for a second attempt&mdash;the
    first having been a failure&mdash;to swim from Tithes Pier to
    Purchase Point Buoy. It was an unfavourable time of the year
    for such an unprecedented feat of natation, but the Hatfield
    Champion was confident of success. He is a perfect whale at
    long-distance immersions, and has been heard to talk of 'twenty
    years of resolute' swimming against stream as a comparative
    trifle. His 'pal and pardner,' SMIFF&mdash;more commonly known
    as the Sanguine Old 'Un&mdash;was equally confident. Two boats
    accompanied the Champion, in one of which was his trusty Pilot,
    SMIFF, and in the other a Party of their 'Mutual Friends.' One
    thing, indeed, was in the Hatfield man's favour; his lately
    cocky and contemptuous competitors had been 'weeded out' by a
    fortuitous series of adverse circumstances, including what
    SOLLY, in a spirit of cynical but excusable elation,
    subsequently called 'that beneficent disease, the Influenza.'
    The Irish Contingent, which not long ago looked dangerous, had
    become so thoroughly demoralised by mutual hostilities and
    disputes between them and their backers, that there was not a
    single 'Paddy' prepared to enter the water when the signal
    'gun' fired for the start. SOLLY, therefore, had it all to
    himself; the performance practically resolves itself into a
    trial of his skill and endurance, and the 'Scythe Bearer' is
    the only enemy against whom the Great Swimmer has to measure
    himself. Indeed, he covered what may be called the first stage
    of his long journey with ease, and in an unexpectedly short
    time. Nevertheless, it is to be feared that 'later on' he will
    have to contend against cold, little or no sun, northerly
    breezes, &amp;c.; the 'flowing tide' will assuredly not always
    be with him, and before he gets to the end of his briny
    journey, even the Hatfield Wonder will probably have 'had
    enough of it.'"</p>

    the old song of "Jim Collins," or, as he writes it, "John
    Collins" (by way of proving that the drink known by that name
    was originated by this individual) but quotes it, to the best
    of our knowledge and belief, inaccurately. It was set to the
    air of "Jenny Jones," and thus it ran:&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 27</i>.&mdash;Quite like
    old times to-night. Public business interrupted, and private
    Member suspended. The victim is ATKINSON, Member for Boston;
    been on the rampage all last week; a terror to the Clerks'
    table; haunting the SPEAKER's Chair, and making the
    Sergeant-at-Arms's flesh creep. Decidedly inconvenient to have
    a gentleman with pale salmon neck-tie and white waistcoat,
    suddenly popping his head round SPEAKER's Chair, and crying,
    "Ah, ah!" "No, you don't!" "Would you, then?" and other
    discursive remarks. Curious how ATKINSON, indulging in these
    luxuries himself; hotly resents attempts by others to enjoy
    similar exotics of conversation. Narrating his grievances just
    now, he dwelt with especial fervour on one of them. "One of the
    Clerks," he told the House, "when I showed him a Motion, said,
    'Oh! oh!' I said, 'Don't say "Oh! oh!" to me.'"</p>

    <p>"Why not?" asked HANKEY, with that direct, almost abrupt
    manner that becomes a Magistrate for Surrey and Chairman of the
    Consolidated Bank. "Why not? Are you to have monopoly of this
    simple interjection? Are you to appropriate all the O's in the
    alphabet? Is not a Clerk at the Table a man and a brother, and
    why may he not, if the idea flashes across his active brain,
    say, 'Oh! oh!'?"</p>

    <p>That rather floored ATKINSON; brought him (so to speak) to
    his senses. Told me afterwards he had never looked on matters
    in that light. Great advantage having a man like HANKEY going
    round prepared at moment's notice to take common-sense view of
    situation and depict it in terse language. Sobering effect on
    ATKINSON only momentary. Whilst SPEAKER was narrating
    circumstances on which he had based charge against him of
    frivolous and vexatious conduct, Member for Boston was bouncing
    about on seat like parched pea, shouting out, "Oh! oh!" "Ah!
    ah!" "No you don't!" and offering other pertinent but
    fragmentary remarks.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"

    <p>"Reminds me," said Member for SARK, "of the scene in the
    Varden household, when <i>Miss Miggs</i> returns expecting to
    be re-instated in her old place of predominance, near the
    person of <i>Dolly's</i> mother. You remember how, when she
    finds the game is up, she turns rusty, and betrays her
    mistress's ability to 'faint away stone dead whenever she had
    the inclinations so to do?' 'Of course,' <i>Miss Miggs</i>
    continues, 'I never see sich cases with my own eyes. Ho, no!
    He, he, he! Nor master neither! Ho, no! He, he, he!'"</p>

    <p>So ATKINSON kept up a running commentary on observations of
    successive Members, including SQUIRE of MALWOOD and JOKIM.
    JOKIM at one time, startled by "Oh! oh!" sounding in his right
    ear as he was making very ordinary observation, nearly fell
    over the folded hands he was nervously rubbing. Situation
    growing embarrassing. ATKINSON popping up with ever-increasing
    vivacity; his "Oh! oh's!" and his "No! no's!" growing in
    frequency and stormy intensity. Must be got rid of somehow; but
    supposing he won't go? Must JOKIM and the Squire, as Mover and
    Seconder of Motion for expulsion, lead him bodily forth? or
    would the Sergeant-at-Arms be called on, and should we see
    revival of the old game, when BRADLAUGH and dear old friend
    GOSSET used to perform a <i>pas de deux</i> between the gaping
    doorway and the astonished Mace? Happily ATKINSON (still like
    <i>Miss Miggs</i>, as SARK insists) suddenly collapsed.</p>

    <p>"It is usual," observed the SPEAKER, "at this point for an
    Hon. Member to withdraw."</p>

    <p>"Oh! Oh!" said ATKINSON, "withdraw? Then I withdraw. But,"
    and here he dropped his voice to impressive whisper, "<i>I will
    come back.</i>" Then, gathering up his papers, he tripped
    lightly forth, and the Varden household&mdash;I mean the House
    of Commons, dropped once more into commonplace.</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;ATKINSON expelled for a
    week.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;SQUIRE of MALWOOD dropped into poetry,
    and was much pleased with little exercise. Backed up JOKIM in
    Motion suspending Twelve o'Clock rule, so as to sit to all
    hours of the night, and wind up business of Session. "We may,"
    he observed, "apply, with a little variation, the late Mr.
    MOORE's verse:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The best of all ways to shorten our days</p>

            <p>Is to steal a few hours from the night."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"That doesn't scan," said CHILDERS, who is nothing if not
    critical.</p>

    <p>"Of course it doesn't," said the SQUIRE, testily; "there are
    a pair of feet left out. But <i>you</i> know, TOBY, how they
    run. The last line should be, 'Is to steal a few hours from the
    night, my Love.' Now, theoretically, and in accordance with
    order, all our observations are directed personally to the
    SPEAKER. Imagine what would have been said if I had completed
    the quotation! I should have been accused of frivolity, and
    perhaps suspended, like ATKINSON. No, Sir, I know what I'm
    about, even when quoting poetry."</p>

    <p>Mention this to illustrate the state of terrorism existing
    in House just now, after blow that fell on ATKINSON. Only man
    who prattles on unconscious of impending doom is MORTON.
    ALPHEUS CLEOPHAS not at all satisfied with condition of
    affairs. ATKINSON has stolen march on him; left him nowhere.
    Determined to-night to pull up lost way. In Committee on Irish
    Votes moved to reduce charge for Dublin Police by £1000;
    proposed to show at some length charge is excessive. Committee
    thought Irish Members might be left to look after that for
    themselves. Howled at ALPHEUS continuously for space of ten
    minutes; then he sat down, moving reduction in dumb show.</p>

    <p>Pity Prince of NAPLES hadn't chosen this time for visit;
    would have given him much livelier impression of the place than
    he gained when he sat in Gallery just after Questions,
    listening to CLARK discoursing about Scotch Crofters to
    audience of nineteen, including SPEAKER. <i>Business
    done.</i>&mdash;Committee of Supply.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;House rapidly thinning;
    AKERS-DOUGLAS has hard work to keep his men together; falling
    off like leaves in wintry weather. Been a long Session, and a
    weary one. Only sense of duty to our QUEEN and Country kept us
    here unto this last.</p>

    <p>"And now I'm off," said SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE. "I don't
    know how you'll get on without me, dear boys."</p>

    <p>"We'll try, we'll try," murmured the Conservatives gathered
    in the smoke-room for the last cigarette.</p>

    <p>"You see," the SAGE continued, "some lives are valuable to
    the country, and must be cared for, whatever violence is done
    to private feeling. For my part, I would much rather be here,
    but RUSTEM ROOSE, He-who-is-to-be-Obeyed, has ordered me to
    Marienbad, and I go. 'But,' like ATKINSON and another ancient
    Roman (of whom you may have read in school-books), 'I return.'
    In the meanwhile, take care of Mr. G. Don't let him overwork
    himself, or ruthlessly endanger his health. It is precious to
    all of us, more especially to some of his colleagues on the
    Front Bench. I often think of what will happen when he retires
    from the scene. I fancy there will be a kind of Suttee. There
    are quite a lot of old wives in his political establishment,
    who cannot resist, what must, indeed, be their natural
    inclination, the call to immolate themselves on the funeral
    pyre. There's &mdash;&mdash;, and &mdash;&mdash;, and
    &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;." (Wild horses couldn't drag
    these names from me. Anyone interested should write to the
    SAGE, <i>Poste Restante Marienbad</i>.) "They could not think
    of lingering on the political scene after the retirement of the
    head of the family. I shall certainly attend the Suttee. It
    will be an interesting and ennobling spectacle. It will,
    moreover, make some room on the newly constructed Treasury
    Bench."</p>

    The two muffled-up figures seen in the background of the
    station are emissaries of AKERS-DOUGLAS charged with the
    mission of ascertaining whether he's really gone.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;House sitting to-day. Should have
    prorogued yesterday at latest; but, somehow, drifting on;
    Members, for their part, drifting off; affairs reached lowest
    level; business practically wound up; but House must needs sit
    another week in order that Appropriation Bill may be got
    through all its stages, and so the Constitution saved.</p>

    <p>Looking round the dull and deadly scene, discover WADDY,
    Q.C., with legs engagingly intertwined, and the forefinger that
    has wagged a verdict out of many juries resting on his massive
    brow. "Got a headache?" I asked, that being the most natural
    thing under the circumstances.</p>

    <p>"No, I've got an idea. I'll pair go off for my well-earned
    holiday, leaving others to look after the Appropriation
    Bill."</p>

    <p>"So will I," I said, suddenly caught and borne away by that
    enthusiasm which has so often influenced amount of damages in
    breach of promise cases. <i>Business

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
